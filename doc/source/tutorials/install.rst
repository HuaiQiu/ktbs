Installing and running kTBS
===========================

These tutorials aim at helping you install kTBS and running it, either as a standalone service or behind an HTTP server such as Apache_ or nginx_.

It has been written using Debian like systems : Debian wheezy (> 7.n) and `Ubuntu server`_ (from 12.10 to 14.10), but should be applicable with only minor changes (if any) to other flavours of Linux, and a few adaptation on MacOS or MS WindowsÂ [#]_.

Common Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

kTBS is a Python_ application, so you need Python installed; more precisely, you need **version 2.7** of Python. kTBS is not compatible with older version, nor with the newer Python 3. Python 2.7 will typically be already pre-installed on your Linux distribution.

As some dependencies need to be compiled, you also need python developer files. You can get them with

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt-get install python-dev

We also advise you to use virtualenv_, this tool creates an isolated Python environment, so that kTBS and its dependencies can be installed without interference with Python packages installed in your system. To install virtualenv_, type

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv
