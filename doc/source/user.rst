Users' documentation
====================

kTBS is a specific DBMS dedicated to traces.


kTBS can be accessed directly through a :doc:`RESTful API <restful-api>`. The alternative is to use a dedicated API in your programming language of choice. The :doc:`developper's section <dev>` of this documentation contains a (still incomplete) client API for Python, but Java_ and PHP_ implementations are also available.

This section addresses a number of subjects that are orthogonal to the way you access kTBS.
